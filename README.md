# Striver's DSA Sheet Practice 🚀

Welcome to my repository! This is where I will be uploading my solutions and notes as I work through **Striver's DSA Sheet** to enhance my problem-solving skills in Data Structures and Algorithms (DSA).

## 📚 About the Repository

This repository is dedicated to documenting my journey as I practice and solve problems from the popular **Striver's DSA Sheet**, a comprehensive collection of DSA problems. The goal is to strengthen my understanding of core concepts, improve coding proficiency, and prepare for technical interviews.

## 🛠️ Structure of the Repository

The problems are organized based on the categories and topics in the DSA sheet. Each folder corresponds to a topic, and the solutions are written in **Java** for better alignment with industry expectations.

### Folder Structure:
- **Arrays**: Problems related to arrays.
- **Linked List**: Singly, Doubly, Circular Linked List.
- **Binary Trees**: Traversals, LCA, and more.
- **Dynamic Programming**: Standard DP problems.
- **Graphs**: BFS, DFS, and other graph algorithms.
- ...and many more!

Each folder contains:
- **Solutions**: Code files for the problems.
- **Explanations**: A brief explanation or approach for each problem (where necessary).

## 💻 Language Used

As most recruiters prefer **Java**, all solutions will be implemented in Java. I aim to write clean, efficient, and well-documented code to make it easy to understand and revisit.

## 🎯 Goals

- Solve all problems from Striver's DSA Sheet.
- Document approaches and learnings for each topic.
- Improve coding speed and accuracy.
- Prepare for upcoming technical interviews.

## 🤝 Contributing

Feel free to fork this repository if you'd like to collaborate or share your solutions. Suggestions, improvements, and discussions are always welcome!

Stay tuned as I upload new solutions and progress through the sheet. Let’s ace DSA together! 💪
